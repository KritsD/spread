                  <p>The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues.</p>

                  <p>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software;
                        web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations;
                        web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge
                        conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity. Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic web
                        and before the corporate web. 'Handmade' is by no means the only or best term to define the web
                        of this period.</p>

                              (2005)</a>, Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as: bright, rich, personal,
                        slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were
                        built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful
                        computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional
                        authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.</p>

                  <p> I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages
                        and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books. I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for <a href="http://luckysoap.com/butterflies/parasite.html">Fishes & Flying Things</a> came from the material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that's the way books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story circled round and round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one copy. The
                        QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of
                        which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it
                        still works.</p>

                  <p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic relationship.
                        This is evident in the early output of the trAce Online Writing Centre founded at Nottingham
                        Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most influential
                        online writing communities in the world. trAce's first output was a word-processed photocopied
                        booklet which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly, trAce's
                        last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:The trAce community embraced both
                        camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions about the use of mixed media in
                        writing… The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce Archive can easily be compared to
                        the multifarious pages of an artist's book. (PDF trAces: A Commemoration of Ten Years of
                        Artistic Innovation at trAce, page 14)</p>

                  <p>One of the many interesting things about the online archive of the trAce Online Writing Centre is
                        how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas
                        archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere —
                        manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom —
                        the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium within
                        which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to change.
                  </p>

                  <p>In <q>Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media</q> (2011)
                        Wolfgang Ernst observes: <q>If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast
                              channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but
                              actively generates sensual and informational presence.</q></p>

                  <p>Similarly, when viewing old web pages in modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox.
                        Layer upon layer of dated web-design aesthetics overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing
                        earlier versions beneath. Pages optimised for lower resolutions now take less than a third of
                        the screen. Ghosts of browsers past mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing
                        images. Sound files play automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to
                        readers who are not us.</p>

                              each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only

                  <p>In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative headline: <a

                              people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves.</q></p>

                  <p>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding <a
                              href="https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835">The Great Web 1.0
                              Revival</a>. Its author Kyle Chayka observed:<q>The booming size of today's mainstream
                              social networks and the constant level of noise we have to deal with has inspired a sudden
                              return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer, and more intimate… We're nostalgic
                              for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where everything was smaller...</q></p>

                  <p>The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social network <a

                        single unix computer. For some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web
                        aesthetics in a contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to
                        view a new net art work <a href="http://tilde.club/~olialia/">640x480</a> - a 4-tab browser
                        installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served as little more than a hip territory
                        to occupy. Many pages remain blank.</p>

                              href="https://github.com/mroth/unindexed">Unindexed</a> which continuously searched Google
                        for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was permanently
                        deleted. Rothberg has since shared the <a href="https://github.com/mroth/unindexed">source code
                              on GitHub</a>, so you too can create a website which self-destructs the moment Google
                        indexes it.</p>

                  <p>Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfort's Taroko Gorge (2008). For many,
                        this was their first experience 'making' a computer-generated text.</p>

                  <p>I have rewritten <a href="https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/">Taroko Gorge</a> three times. Further to
                        the close relation between the handmade web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output
                        and source code from the first iteration, <a
                              href="http://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html">Gorge (2010)</a>, were published in my
                        very small press print book <a
                              href="http://luckysoap.com/generations/generations.html">GENERATION[S] (2010)</a>, which,
                        I believe, is now only available as a PDF. <a
                              href="http://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html">Gorge</a> is a never-ending tract of
                        computer-generated text spewing verse approximations, poetic paroxysms on food, consumption,
                        decadence, and desire.</p>

                  <p>Consider the manual labour carried out by the mouse hand in Daniel Eatock's <a
                              href="https://www.onemilescroll.com/">The One Mile Scroll (2008)</a> A few entries appear
                        at the top of the screen - Denver, The Mile High City - my grandfather's grave, Denver - after
                        that we scroll and scroll. The hand is made to work. Through the labour of the body the virtual
                        space of the browser window is transformed into an actual, physical distance.</p>

                  <p>Ironically, handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web. In <a

                              Writing Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound (2014)</a>, Lori Emerson argues:
                        <q>The iPad works because users can't know how it works</q> (15). Reading the web on an iPhone,
                        iPad, or similar device, readers do not have the option of viewing the page source. The iPad
                        provides consumers with access to materials created by others, but cannot easily be used as a
                        tool in the handcrafting of new materials.</p>

                  <p>In today's highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications,
                        read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital
                        publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental web
                        art and writing projects.</p>

                  <p>The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I am to
                        using it in poetic and intransigent ways.</p>
